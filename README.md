### 🌀 AutoPearlStasis
Merged + upgraded pearl stasis system with **MAIN** (sender) and **ALT** (receiver) modes, dual-alt support, proximity triggers, and a full **post-teleport re-arm assist** (walk to edge → look down → throw → step back). Also supports Baritone pathing if present.

**Modes**
- `mode`: `MAIN` (your main account—sends /msg and re-arms stasis) or `ALT` (your alt—flips trapdoor on command and reopens it).
- **Dual Alt** on MAIN: independently configure **Alt #1** and **Alt #2** (name, totem threshold, force toggle, hotkey).

**How MAIN works**
- Tracks your **totem count** and sends `/msg <alt> "<count> totem remaining"` when ≤ per-alt threshold.
- **Force Teleport** per-alt: toggle or **hotkey** (e.g., `G`, `F4`, `SPACE`); fires immediately.
- **Proximity Trigger** (optional): if a watched player enters radius, auto-/msg an alt and start teleport flow.
- Detects teleport by **position jump** or by receiving **`tp-ok`** from ALT to start the re-arm assist.

**How ALT works**
- Listens for `/msg` from your **Main Name** containing "`totem remaining`".
- If the number ≤ `totem-threshold`, it finds the **nearest armed stasis** (water + trapdoor + pearl), flips the **trapdoor**, and (optionally) sends **`tp-ok`** back to MAIN.
- Reopens the trapdoor after a delay to keep the chamber armed.

**Re-Arm Assist (MAIN, after teleport)**
- Searches for the closest valid stasis (water under trapdoor) within a **search radius**.
- Walks to the **edge** facing the water, looks **down**, ensures pearl ready (offhand/hotbar/silent-swap/inventory pull), **throws**, and **steps back** to a safe block; verifies pearl landed.
- Includes robust **water-exit** logic and optional **Baritone** pathing.
- Retries throw on miss (configurable count).

---

- `temp-hotbar-slot`: Fallback hotbar slot [0–8] if no empty slot.

---

#### Notes
- MAIN sends messages like: `"/msg <alt> <N> totem remaining"`. ALT parses the **number** and flips the nearest armed stasis if `N ≤ totem-threshold`.
- ALT verifies **water + trapdoor + a pearl in the water** before flipping; then **reopens** the trapdoor after `reopen-delay-ticks`.
- Assist uses rotation packets (`LookAndOnGround`) and checks **pearl cooldown** to infer throw success; also explicitly counts pearls inside the stasis water.

### AntiFeetPlace
Disrupts enemy **feetplace/surround** by mining the block **below** a surround face and placing an **Ender Chest** there, then (optionally) placing **obsidian** beside it to prep a crystal base. Includes bedrock handling, rate-limit safety, and a wait/retarget loop to keep the hole open.
- **Targeting:** Picks the **nearest enemy** within `range`, preferring the surround **facing you** (for ideal chest→obsidian→you alignment).
- **Below logic:**
    - If **ender chest already below**: enter WAIT mode (or yield/hold per settings).
    - If **bedrock below** and allowed: **hold-mine** it up to `bedrock-hold-max-ticks` (skips world bottom layer if enabled).
    - If **other block** below: **tap-mine** it for `tap-ticks-below` ticks.
    - If **air** below: tap the **surround** for `tap-ticks-surround` ticks so rebreak targets it, then **place chest**.
- **Chest placement:** Always places **directly under the chosen surround**; rotates first if enabled; renders intended placement if enabled.
- **Bridge for crystal (optional):** Tries up to four sides (biased toward you) to place **obsidian** beside the chest, with optional **clearance mining** and verifying **two air blocks above** for crystal placement.
- **Hold / Wait loop:** After placing, either **disable immediately**, **hold** for `post-place-pause` ticks, or **wait while chest present**, periodically retargeting the surround so your autominers keep that hole open.

**Safety & QoL**
- **Rate limiting:** Enforces `mine-rate-limit-ticks` between tap/mine packets to avoid speedmine resets/kicks.
- **Filters:** Ignore friends, armourless players (“nakeds”), unbreakables below (except allowed bedrock), and extra “hard” blocks you specify.
- **Inventory:** Finds **ender chest** / **obsidian** in **hotbar**, then falls back to **main inventory**.

**Settings (General)**
- `range` — Max target distance.
- `rotate` — Rotate during taps/placement/bedrock hold.
- `tap-ticks-below` — Ticks to tap the **below** block before moving on.
- `tap-ticks-surround` — Ticks to tap the **surround** before chest placement.
- `render-placement` — Let BlockUtils render intended placement.
- `disable-after-place` — Toggle off immediately after placing chest.
- `post-place-pause` — If not disabling, **hold** this many ticks so autominers can work.
- `wait-while-chest-present` — While a chest sits below, don’t re-mine the below block.
- `max-wait-chest-ticks` — 0 = wait indefinitely; otherwise leave WAIT after N ticks.
- `retarget-while-chest-present` — Keep tapping the surround to keep the hole open.
- `wait-retarget-interval` — Tick interval between those taps.

**Bridge / Crystal Prep**
- `place-obsidian-bridge` — Place **obsidian** beside the chest (same Y) on any open side.
- `bridge-mine-if-blocking` — Briefly mine to clear the bridge spot / clearance.
- `bridge-prep-max-ticks` — Max ticks to try clearing.
- `ensure-crystal-clearance` — Ensure **two air blocks above** the bridge for crystal placement.

**Bedrock Behavior**
- `allow-bedrock-break` — Hold-mine bedrock below surround (server permitting).
- `skip-bottom-bedrock-layer` — Skip world bottommost Y.
- `bedrock-hold-max-ticks` — Abort hold-mining if bedrock didn’t break in time.

**Packet / Kick Safety**
- `mine-rate-limit-ticks` — Minimum ticks between any tap/mine packets.

**Filters**
- `ignore-friends` — Skip friends.
- `ignore-nakeds` — Skip unarmoured players.
- `skip-unbreakable-below` — Skip below blocks with hardness < 0 (except allowed bedrock).
- `skip-hard-below` — Skip if below block is in the “hard” list.

### BetterScaffold
Automatically places blocks under (or above) you for safe bridging/towering. Hotbar-aware with autoswitch, yaw/pitch rotation, optional air-place, level lock, and fading box renders. *(Credits: TrouserStreak addon)*

- **Placement modes:** `BelowFeet` (standard scaffold) or `AboveHead` (places a ceiling at a configurable offset).
- **Air Place:** When enabled, places at your projected position (player pos + velocity − 0.5Y).  
  When disabled, scans within a radius to find the nearest **non-air** block and places adjacent to it (respects `closest-block-range`).

- **Horizontal/Vertical Fill:** Expands placement in a configurable cross/square pattern around/above/below you.
- **Fast Tower:** Adds jump velocity while holding jump (and slight downward nudge post-place) for rapid upward stacking.
- **Block Filter:** Only places **full-cube** blocks from your hotbar, with **Whitelist/Blacklist** control. Prevents placing falling blocks over air.
- **Selection & Switch:** Searches **hotbar** for valid blocks; will **Auto Switch** if allowed.
- **Rotation & Swing:** Optionally rotates toward the place pos; optional **client-side swing** render.
- **Visuals:** Fading box render on each placed block with configurable line/side colors and shape mode.

- `swing` — Render client-side swing animation on place.
- `auto-switch` — Auto swap to a valid block before placing.
- `rotate` — Rotate toward the block being placed.
- `air-place` — Allow placing without a neighbor (uses projected position).
- `closest-block-range` — Max search distance for a solid neighbor (only visible when `air-place` is **off**).
