---

## v0.1.5 - July 25th 2025
### Added

### AntiConcreteDetection
- Detects buttons or torches placed under nearby enemies' feet.
  - Breaks detected blocks with left-click, with toggle for `Tap to break` vs `Hold to break`.
  - Includes `Rotate` toggle for snapping to face target block.
  - `Hold to break` now only targets the block at the enemy's feet (inside lower hitbox), preventing accidental block breaking based on camera direction.

### AutoConcrete
- `Only In Hole` setting for `AutoConcrete`:
    - Ensures concrete only drops if the target is fully surrounded by blocks at their feet.
- Added more support for falling blocks:
    - Concrete Powder
    - Gravel
    - Sand
    - Red Sand
    - Suspicious Sand
    - Suspicious Gravel

### Fixed
- Crash caused by null concrete positions in `AutoConcrete`.
- Crash when using `AntiConcreteDetection` and `AutoConcrete` simultaneously due to missing null checks and out-of-bounds access.
- `Hold to break` logic no longer breaks random blocks based on view directionâ€”targeting is now precise to block under enemy.

### Changed
- Separated `Anti-AntiConcrete` functionality from `AntiConcrete` into its own module (`AntiConcreteDetection`).
- Improved obsidian pillar placement logic and support check before dropping blocks.
- Added safe loop over concrete position array with null checks.

### AntiConcrete
- Added `anti-anticoncrete` toggle to break **enemy buttons or torches** placed under them.

    - `Tap`: Single hit to break target block
